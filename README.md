# Turtle-Practice

### Introduction

`turtle` is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. With the Python `turtle` library, you can draw and create various types of shapes and images.
